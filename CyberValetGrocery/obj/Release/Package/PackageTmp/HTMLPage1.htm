If you order online from<em>Go Grocery Go.com </em> you will receive your weekly order of Groceries, Lasagna and Fresh Bread for dinner that night from Buon Giorno, and two nice bottles of Cabernet from our Wine & Spirits Shop.  All delivered to your door “in about an hour” for a flat fee of $9.95.   If you don’t need your order immediately, you may also choose to schedule same day delivery for $4.95 with delivery options starting 3 hours from the time you place your order.      <br />

<p>Our competition relegates you to old fashioned next day delivery coupled with the inconvenient cable company model of "we'll be there sometime between 1-5pm".    Our Personal Shoppers and Delivery Drivers are stationed right at the store awaiting your order.   We have already begun shopping for your items in the time it takes you to locate your car keys.  I guess you could say we are literally "here" to deliver for you.   </p>

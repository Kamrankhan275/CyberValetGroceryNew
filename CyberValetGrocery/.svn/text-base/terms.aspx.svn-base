                            <strong>1.Cyber Valet Grocery’s Delivery Service and Website.</strong>
                             The Cyber Valet Grocery service is a transaction, information and communication service available to authorized users ("customers") who access <a href="https://cybervaletgrocery.com/" target="self" class="Userlink1">www.CyberValetGrocery.com</a> CVG currently provides an online grocery shopping and delivery service, and may in the future provide additional shopping and related services.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <ol style ="padding-right :5px;padding-left :0px" >

                            <li><strong>a.Grocery Shopping and Delivery Service.
                             </strong>Cyber Valet Grocery's employees, agents or designees will shop and deliver grocery orders placed with Cyber Valet Grocery. Delivery will be made to the delivery address that you specify when you place your first order. Payment for groceries and associated shopping and delivery fees is due at the time of checkout. (Vacation guest, please refer to [b] of this section) You are responsible for ensuring that someone is present at the delivery address to receive and pay for deliveries at the specified time of delivery. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the order. If Cyber Valet Grocery Delivery cannot deliver your order, or must make an additional delivery because no one is at the delivery address to receive and pay for the order at the specified time, you will be assessed an additional fee. If you are not satisfied with an item purchased through the CVG, you may return it and it will be credited against your next CVG order. If an item you choose is not in inventory, we reserve the right to replace the item with an equivalent product. We will adjust the price if the product is less, and we will not charge more if the product is more. Cyber Valet Grocery's liability for missing a delivery or pickup time is limited to delivery at a later agreed time at no additional charge.</strong><br />
                             <br />
                                    <li> <strong>b. Grocery delivery to vacation addresses. 
                                    </strong> As part of our service to the vacationing guest we set the delivery to a logistical route with no set time of delivery.  Instead, the delivery begins at noon and in most cases is completed between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm depending on number of deliveries and traffic that day; We will secure access to the vacation address and place the groceries appropriately.  There is a service fee for this which can be seen during check out and must be purchased by clicking on the add button.<br />
                                   <br /> In some areas, you may choose to receive your Cyber Valet Grocery order as an unattended delivery, and your order will be left unattended at your door or other place you designate. CVG may also choose to leave your order unattended in a convenient location if an appropriate person is not present to receive deliveries. Cyber Valet Grocery is not responsible, and you agree not to hold CVG or its employees responsible, for any damage or theft that occurs to an unattended delivery. CVG reserves the right to refuse to leave an order unattended if the Cyber Valet Grocery delivery Driver considers the circumstances to be unsuitable or unsafe for any reason.
